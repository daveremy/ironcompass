# IronCompass Usage Guide

IronCompass is a personal health tracking platform. You log data via MCP tools and the user views it on a web dashboard.

## Core Pattern: Query Before Log

Always call `ironcompass_query_today` before prompting the user to log data. This shows what's already recorded so you can focus on what's missing and avoid duplicate inserts. When logging past days, pass the target date — e.g., `ironcompass_query_today` with `date: "2026-03-07"` — not today's date.

## Data Dependencies

Most tables have a foreign key to `daily_entries`. The log tools handle this automatically — you do **not** need to call `ironcompass_log_daily` first. The first log call for any date auto-creates a minimal daily entry.

## Upsert vs Insert Tools

Calling the wrong tool twice has different consequences:

**Upsert tools** (safe to re-call, updates existing row):
- `ironcompass_log_daily`, `ironcompass_log_sleep`, `ironcompass_log_fasting`, `ironcompass_log_pullups`, `ironcompass_log_bodycomp` — all keyed on date

**Insert tools** (creates a new row every call — will duplicate if called twice):
- `ironcompass_log_bp`, `ironcompass_log_workout`, `ironcompass_log_meal`, `ironcompass_log_metric`

For insert tools, always check `ironcompass_query_today` first to avoid duplicating existing records.

**Merge tool:**
- `ironcompass_log_supplements` — merges new supplements with the existing list for that date, does not overwrite

## Tool Parameters

All log tools accept an optional `date` (YYYY-MM-DD). If omitted, defaults to today. Always use explicit dates when logging past days.

### Supplements
Pass as an array of lowercase, hyphenated strings: `["vitamin-d", "omega-3", "creatine"]`.

### Custom Metrics
The `name` is automatically lowercased. Multiple entries per day per metric are summed in the dashboard. Include `unit` on at least the first entry (e.g., "cups", "ml").

### Workout Details
The `details` field is a JSON object with type-specific structure:
- Strength: `{"exercises": [{"name": "Bench Press", "sets": [{"reps": 8, "weight": 135}]}]}`
- Hike/Run: `{"trail": "Mission Peak", "out_and_back": true}`
- Golf: `{"course": "Pebble Beach", "score": 92, "holes": 18}`

Use `ironcompass_list_workout_types` to get valid type names. The `source` field defaults to "manual" — set to "apple_health", "hevy", "strava", etc. for integration data.

`start_time` and `end_time` accept HH:MM (auto-converted using the workout date) or full ISO 8601 datetime strings.

## Query Tools

**`ironcompass_query_today`** — All data for a single date. Accepts optional `date` param.

**`ironcompass_query_week`** — Last 7 days with aggregates (weight delta, avg sleep, workout count, protein/calories, fasting compliance, alcohol, pullups, custom metrics). Does not include streaks — call `ironcompass_query_streak` separately. Always returns last 7 days from today — does not accept a date parameter.

**`ironcompass_query_trend`** — Time-series points and summary stats over N days. Built-in metrics: `weight`, `energy`, `sleep`, `hrv`, `hr-sleep`, `readiness`, `bp`, `pullups`, `calories`, `protein`, `body-fat`. Also accepts any custom metric name (aggregated as daily sums).

**`ironcompass_query_streak`** — Current streak count and start date. Valid: `alcohol-free`, `fasting`, `workout`, `logging`. Streaks skip today if not yet logged (so a streak doesn't break just because it's morning).

## Delete Tools

Require a UUID from a prior query result. Always confirm with the user before deleting.
- `ironcompass_delete_workout`, `ironcompass_delete_meal`, `ironcompass_delete_metric`

## Dashboard URLs

Every response includes a `dashboard_url`. URL patterns for deep linking:
- `/?view=daily&date=YYYY-MM-DD` — day view
- `/?view=weekly&date=YYYY-MM-DD` — weekly view (date = Monday)
- `/?view=metrics` — trends and streaks
- `/?month=YYYY-MM-DD` — calendar month
